# Handwritten Digit Recognition using KNN, SVM, and Random Forest Classifier

## Overview
This project implements a handwritten digit recognition system using three different machine learning algorithms: **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**, **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**, and **Random Forest Classifier (RFC)**. The dataset used for training and evaluation is the well-known **MNIST dataset**.

## Models and Accuracy
The performance of each model was evaluated on training, validation, and test datasets. Below are the final accuracy results:

### K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- **Training Accuracy**: 97.48%
- **Validation Accuracy**: 97.48%
- **Test Accuracy**: 96.74%

### Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- **Training Accuracy**: 98.06%
- **Validation Accuracy**: 98.06%
- **Test Accuracy**: 97.81%

### Random Forest Classifier (RFC)
- **Training Accuracy**: 96.87%
- **Validation Accuracy**: 96.87%
- **Test Accuracy**: 96.79%

## Dataset
The dataset is taken from **MNIST dataset**.


## Results and Analysis
- **SVM achieved the highest accuracy (97.81%) on the test dataset, making it the best performer.**
- **KNN also performed well with 96.74% accuracy, but it is computationally expensive for large datasets.**
- **Random Forest performed slightly lower but still provided competitive results with 96.79% accuracy.**

## Future Improvements
- Experiment with **hyperparameter tuning** to further improve model performance.
- Implement **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** for better feature extraction and accuracy.
- Optimize computational efficiency for real-time digit recognition.
